Welcome to the repository for our project submitted for the Bank of Baroda Hackathon 2024. Our team, Entropy, has developed a solution for Challenge 6: Personalized Content Generation. This README provides an overview of our project, including its features, architecture, and key differentiators.

## Team Name
**Entropy**

## Team Bio
Entropy's multifaceted team excels in UI/UX, Backend, GenAI, Machine Learning, and ideation, with a proven track record of winning multiple hackathons using cutting-edge tech.

## Challenge
### Personalized Content Generation
We developed a system that provides personalized content with marketing of bank policies and schemes, generating financial reports and educational videos to ensure user engagement. Our solution utilizes WhatsApp Chatbot, Callbot, and Emails to enhance customer experience.

## Key Features
- **Personalized Communication**: Incorporates user feedback, addresses individual preferences and needs, and provides personalized communication, including multilingual content in English and Hindi.

- **Enhanced Customer Retention**: Offers a customer-centric service that can attract new customers and retain existing ones.
- **Financial Literacy**: Provides personalized financial education content through videos, calls, and messages to enable customers to make informed financial decisions.

## Pre-Requisite Alternatives
- **Invideo AI**: Generates marketing content and offers video creation tools but lacks tailored solutions for the banking sector.
- **Contents.com**: Provides content generation services but does not offer in-depth solutions tailored to the banking industry.
- **ChatGPT and Various Chatbots**: Generic responses without deep personalization based on individual customer data, and security concerns.

## Tools and Resources
- **Azure Cloud Services**: Including Azure App Service, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Cognitive Services, Azure DevOps, and Azure Storage.
- **Technologies**: Next.js for front-end development, FastAPI for backend API development, Twilio for WhatsApp bot and call connection, OpenAI ChatGPT, and PostgreSQL Database.

## System Architecture
- **Front-End**: User Interface using Next.js with responsive design.
- **Back-End**: Data processing with Python and Azure services for hosting and management.
- **AI and NLP Services**: Azure Cognitive Services for NLP and Speech, AI bots for customer interactions.
- **Scalability and Maintenance**: Uses Azure hosting and storage solutions, FastAPI for high concurrency, and regular updates and monitoring for security and issue resolution.

- **Multilingual Support**: Content in both English and Hindi for broader accessibility.
- **Operational Efficiency**: AI-driven content generation reduces manual effort.
- **Scalability**: Handles increasing customer base without compromising performance.

## Adoption Plan
- **Pilot Program**: Implement in select branches for initial feedback.
- **Educational Campaigns**: Inform customers through emails, SMS, and in-branch posters.
- **Staff Training**: Provide guides and support for employees.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly collect and analyze customer feedback.

## Business Potential and Relevance
Our solution aims to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty, improve operational efficiency, and contribute to social causes like financial literacy. According to McKinsey, GenAI could add $200 to $340 billion per year in revenue for the banking industry through improved productivity.

## Security Considerations
- **General Security**: Regular updates, logging and monitoring, and security audits.
- **WhatsApp Bot and Call Connection**: Twilio provides authentication and encryption.
- **Next.js**: Built-in security features like Content Security Policy (CSP).
- **ChatGPT Integration**: Uses Azure mechanisms for resource access control.
- **Azure Services**: Role-based access control (RBAC) and automatic security updates for PostgreSQL.

## Higher Concurrency and Rate Limits
The Enterprise plan increases the number of concurrent requests and API calls our system can handle, ensuring scalability and performance.
